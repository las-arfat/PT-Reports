weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

This security advisory has been rated as having important security
impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

These new kernel packages contain fixes for the security issues
described below :

* a flaw in the connection tracking support for SCTP that allowed a
remote user to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL
pointer. (CVE-2007-2876, Important)

* a flaw in the mount handling routine for 64-bit systems that allowed
a local user to cause denial of service (crash). (CVE-2006-7203,
Important)

* a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding base that allowed a local user to
cause an out-of-bounds access. (CVE-2007-2172, Important)

* a flaw in the PPP over Ethernet implementation that allowed a local
user to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by creating a
socket using connect and then releasing it before the PPPIOCGCHAN
ioctl has been called. (CVE-2007-2525, Important)

* a flaw in the fput ioctl handling of 32-bit applications running on
64-bit platforms that allowed a local user to cause a denial of
service (panic). (CVE-2007-0773, Important)

* a flaw in the NFS locking daemon that allowed a local user to cause
denial of service (deadlock). (CVE-2006-5158, Moderate)

* a flaw in the sysfs_readdir function that allowed a local user to
cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.

* a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to
trigger an information leak. (CVE-2007-1353, Low)

In addition, the following bugs were addressed :

* the NFS could recurse on the same spinlock. Also, NFS, under certain
conditions, did not completely clean up Posix locks on a file close,
leading to mount failures.

* the 32bit compatibility didn't return to userspace correct values
for the rt_sigtimedwait system call.

* the count for unused inodes could be incorrect at times, resulting
in dirty data not being written to disk in a timely manner.

* the cciss driver had an incorrect disk size calculation (off-by-one
error) which prevented disk dumps.

These updated kernel packages fix the following security issues :

A flaw was found in the virtual filesystem (VFS). A local unprivileged
user could truncate directories to which they had write permission;
this could render the contents of the directory inaccessible.
(CVE-2008-0001, Important)

A flaw was found in the implementation of ptrace. A local unprivileged
user could trigger this flaw and possibly cause a denial of service
(system hang). (CVE-2007-5500, Important)

A flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel
handled page faults when a CPU used the NUMA method for accessing
memory on Itanium architectures. A local unprivileged user could
trigger this flaw and cause a denial of service (system panic).
(CVE-2007-4130, Important)

A possible NULL pointer dereference was found in the chrp_show_cpuinfo
function when using the PowerPC architecture. This may have allowed a
local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service (crash).

A flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local
user can get a root-owned process to dump a core file into a

Tk is a graphical toolkit for the Tcl scripting language.

An input validation flaw was discovered in Tk's GIF image handling. A
code-size value read from a GIF image was not properly validated
before being used, leading to a buffer overflow. A specially crafted
GIF file could use this to cause a crash or, potentially, execute code
with the privileges of the application using the Tk graphical toolkit.
(CVE-2008-0553)

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in Tk's animated GIF image
handling. An animated GIF containing an initial image smaller than
subsequent images could cause a crash or, potentially, execute code
with the privileges of the application using the Tk library.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the CIFS virtual file system. A
remote authenticated user could issue a request that could lead to a
denial of service. (CVE-2007-5904, Moderate)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bugs :

* a bug was found in the Linux kernel audit subsystem. When the audit
daemon was setup to log the execve system call with a large number of
arguments, the kernel could run out out memory while attempting to
create audit log messages. This could cause a kernel panic. In these
updated packages, large audit messages are split into acceptable
sizes, which resolves this issue.

* on certain Intel chipsets, it was not possible to load the acpiphp
module using the 'modprobe acpiphp' command. Because the acpiphp
module did not recurse across PCI bridges, hardware detection for PCI
hot plug slots failed. In these updated packages, hardware detection
works correctly.

* on IBM System z architectures that run the IBM z/VM hypervisor, the
IBM eServer zSeries HiperSockets network interface (layer 3) allowed
ARP packets to be sent and received, even when the 'NOARP' flag was
set. These ARP packets caused problems for virtual machines.

* it was possible for the iounmap function to sleep while holding a
lock. This may have caused a deadlock for drivers and other code that
uses the iounmap function. In these updated packages, the lock is
dropped before the sleep code is called, which resolves this issue.

Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
servers to authenticate to each other through use of symmetric
encryption and a trusted third party, the KDC.

A flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos Authentication Service
and Key Distribution Center server (krb5kdc) handled Kerberos v4
protocol packets. An unauthenticated remote attacker could use this
flaw to crash the krb5kdc daemon, disclose portions of its memory, or
possibly execute arbitrary code using malformed or truncated Kerberos
v4 protocol requests. (CVE-2008-0062, CVE-2008-0063)

This issue only affected krb5kdc with Kerberos v4 protocol
compatibility enabled, which is the default setting on Red Hat

Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files,
printers, and other information.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Samba clients
handle over-sized packets. If a client connected to a malicious Samba
server, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the Samba client
user. It was also possible for a remote user to send a specially
crafted print request to a Samba server that could result in the
server executing the vulnerable client code, resulting in arbitrary
code execution with the permissions of the Samba server.
(CVE-2008-1105)

These updated packages fix the following security issues :

* A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel memory copy routines,
when running on certain AMD64 systems. If an unsuccessful attempt to
copy kernel memory from source to destination memory locations
occurred, the copy routines did not zero the content at the
destination memory location. This could allow a local unprivileged
user to view potentially sensitive data. (CVE-2008-2729, Important)

* Alexey Dobriyan discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel
process-tracing system call, ptrace. A local unprivileged user could
use this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel hang).
(CVE-2008-2365, Important)

* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the Linux kernel 32-bit and
64-bit emulation. This could allow a local unprivileged user to
prepare and run a specially crafted binary, which would use this
deficiency to leak uninitialized and potentially sensitive data.
(CVE-2008-0598, Important)

* It was discovered that the Linux kernel handled string operations in
the opposite way to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This could
allow a local unprivileged user to cause memory corruption.
(CVE-2008-1367, Low)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bug :

* On systems with a large number of CPUs (more than 16), multiple

available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

[Updated 10th July 2008] We have updated the Enterprise Linux 5
packages in this advisory. The default and sample caching-nameserver
configuration files have been updated so that they do not specify a
fixed query-source port. Administrators wishing to take advantage of
randomized UDP source ports should check their configuration file to
ensure they have not specified fixed query-source ports.

ISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the
DNS (Domain Name System) protocols.

The DNS protocol protects against spoofing attacks by requiring an
attacker to predict both the DNS transaction ID and UDP source port of
a request. In recent years, a number of papers have found problems
with DNS implementations which make it easier for an attacker to
perform DNS cache-poisoning attacks.

Previous versions of BIND did not use randomized UDP source ports. If
an attacker was able to predict the random DNS transaction ID, this
could make DNS cache-poisoning attacks easier. In order to provide
more resilience, BIND has been updated to use a range of random UDP
source ports. (CVE-2008-1447)

Note: This errata also updates SELinux policy on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4 and 5 to allow BIND to use random UDP source ports.

Users of BIND are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to add this functionality.

Red Hat would like to thank Dan Kaminsky for reporting this issue.","Update the affected bind and / or selinux-policy packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?c90bb469

cURL is a tool for getting files from FTP, HTTP, Gopher, Telnet, and
Dict servers, using any of the supported protocols. cURL is designed
to work without user interaction or any kind of interactivity.

David Kierznowski discovered a flaw in libcurl where it would not
differentiate between different target URLs when handling automatic
redirects. This caused libcurl to follow any new URL that it
understood, including the 'file://' URL type. This could allow a
remote server to force a local libcurl-using application to read a
local file instead of the remote one, possibly exposing local files
that were not meant to be exposed. (CVE-2009-0037)

Note: Applications using libcurl that are expected to follow redirects
to 'file://' protocol must now explicitly call curl_easy_setopt(3) and
set the newly introduced CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS option as required.

cURL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. All running applications

Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system.

These updated kernel packages contain fixes for the following security
issues :

* A flaw was found in the handling of process death signals. This
allowed a local user to send arbitrary signals to the suid-process
executed by that user. A successful exploitation of this flaw depends
on the structure of the suid-program and its signal handling.
(CVE-2007-3848, Important)

* A flaw was found in the CIFS file system. This could cause the umask
values of a process to not be honored on CIFS file systems where UNIX
extensions are supported. (CVE-2007-3740, Important)

* A flaw was found in the VFAT compat ioctl handling on 64-bit
systems. This allowed a local user to corrupt a kernel_dirent struct
and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-2878, Important)

* A flaw was found in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A
local user who had the ability to read the /proc/driver/snd-page-alloc
file could see portions of kernel memory. (CVE-2007-4571, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the aacraid SCSI driver. This allowed a local
user to make ioctl calls to the driver that should be restricted to
privileged users. (CVE-2007-4308, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the stack expansion when using the hugetlb
kernel on PowerPC systems. This allowed a local user to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2007-3739, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the handling of zombie processes. A local user
could create processes that would not be properly reaped which could
lead to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-6921, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the CIFS file system handling. The mount option
'sec=' did not enable integrity checking or produce an error message
if used. (CVE-2007-3843, Low)

* A flaw was found in the random number generator implementation that
allowed a local user to cause a denial of service or possibly gain
privileges. This flaw could be exploited if the root user raised the
default wakeup threshold over the size of the output pool.
(CVE-2007-3105, Low)

Additionally, the following bugs were fixed :

* A flaw was found in the kernel netpoll code, creating a potential
deadlock condition. If the xmit_lock for a given network interface is
held, and a subsequent netpoll event is generated from within the lock
owning context (a console message for example), deadlock on that cpu
will result, because the netpoll code will attempt to re-acquire the
xmit_lock. The fix is to, in the netpoll code, only attempt to take
the lock, and fail if it is already acquired (rather than block on
it), and queue the message to be sent for later delivery. Any user of
netpoll code in the kernel (netdump or netconsole services), is
exposed to this problem, and should resolve the issue by upgrading to
this kernel release immediately.

* A flaw was found where, under 64-bit mode (x86_64), AMD processors
were not able to address greater than a 40-bit physical address space;
and Intel processors were only able to address up to a 36-bit physical
address space. The fix is to increase the physical addressing for an
AMD processor to 48 bits, and an Intel processor to 38 bits. Please
see the Red Hat Knowledgebase for more detailed information.

Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system.

These updated kernel packages contain fixes for the following security
issues :

* A flaw was found in the handling of process death signals. This
allowed a local user to send arbitrary signals to the suid-process
executed by that user. A successful exploitation of this flaw depends
on the structure of the suid-program and its signal handling.
(CVE-2007-3848, Important)

* A flaw was found in the CIFS file system. This could cause the umask
values of a process to not be honored on CIFS file systems where UNIX
extensions are supported. (CVE-2007-3740, Important)

* A flaw was found in the VFAT compat ioctl handling on 64-bit
systems. This allowed a local user to corrupt a kernel_dirent struct
and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-2878, Important)

* A flaw was found in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A
local user who had the ability to read the /proc/driver/snd-page-alloc
file could see portions of kernel memory. (CVE-2007-4571, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the aacraid SCSI driver. This allowed a local
user to make ioctl calls to the driver that should be restricted to
privileged users. (CVE-2007-4308, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the stack expansion when using the hugetlb
kernel on PowerPC systems. This allowed a local user to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2007-3739, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the handling of zombie processes. A local user
could create processes that would not be properly reaped which could
lead to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-6921, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the CIFS file system handling. The mount option
'sec=' did not enable integrity checking or produce an error message
if used. (CVE-2007-3843, Low)

* A flaw was found in the random number generator implementation that
allowed a local user to cause a denial of service or possibly gain
privileges. This flaw could be exploited if the root user raised the
default wakeup threshold over the size of the output pool.
(CVE-2007-3105, Low)

Additionally, the following bugs were fixed :

* A flaw was found in the kernel netpoll code, creating a potential
deadlock condition. If the xmit_lock for a given network interface is
held, and a subsequent netpoll event is generated from within the lock
owning context (a console message for example), deadlock on that cpu
will result, because the netpoll code will attempt to re-acquire the
xmit_lock. The fix is to, in the netpoll code, only attempt to take
the lock, and fail if it is already acquired (rather than block on
it), and queue the message to be sent for later delivery. Any user of
netpoll code in the kernel (netdump or netconsole services), is
exposed to this problem, and should resolve the issue by upgrading to
this kernel release immediately.

* A flaw was found where, under 64-bit mode (x86_64), AMD processors
were not able to address greater than a 40-bit physical address space;
and Intel processors were only able to address up to a 36-bit physical
address space. The fix is to increase the physical addressing for an
AMD processor to 48 bits, and an Intel processor to 38 bits. Please
see the Red Hat Knowledgebase for more detailed information.

lead to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-6921, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the CIFS file system handling. The mount option
'sec=' did not enable integrity checking or produce an error message
if used. (CVE-2007-3843, Low)

* A flaw was found in the random number generator implementation that
allowed a local user to cause a denial of service or possibly gain
privileges. This flaw could be exploited if the root user raised the
default wakeup threshold over the size of the output pool.
(CVE-2007-3105, Low)

Additionally, the following bugs were fixed :

* A flaw was found in the kernel netpoll code, creating a potential
deadlock condition. If the xmit_lock for a given network interface is
held, and a subsequent netpoll event is generated from within the lock
owning context (a console message for example), deadlock on that cpu
will result, because the netpoll code will attempt to re-acquire the
xmit_lock. The fix is to, in the netpoll code, only attempt to take
the lock, and fail if it is already acquired (rather than block on
it), and queue the message to be sent for later delivery. Any user of
netpoll code in the kernel (netdump or netconsole services), is
exposed to this problem, and should resolve the issue by upgrading to
this kernel release immediately.

* A flaw was found where, under 64-bit mode (x86_64), AMD processors
were not able to address greater than a 40-bit physical address space;
and Intel processors were only able to address up to a 36-bit physical
address space. The fix is to increase the physical addressing for an
AMD processor to 48 bits, and an Intel processor to 38 bits. Please
see the Red Hat Knowledgebase for more detailed information.

* A flaw was found in the xenU kernel that may prevent a
paravirtualized guest with more than one CPU from starting when
running under an Enterprise Linux 5.1 hypervisor. The fix is to allow
your Enterprise Linux 4 Xen SMP guests to boot under a 5.1 hypervisor.

The Common UNIX(r) Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing
layer for UNIX operating systems.

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder.
An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the 'lp' user if the
file was printed. (CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-1179)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder.
An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the 'lp' user if the
file was printed. (CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-1182)

Multiple flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder that could lead to
the freeing of arbitrary memory. An attacker could create a malicious
PDF file that would cause CUPS to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code as the 'lp' user if the file was printed.
(CVE-2009-0166, CVE-2009-1180)

Multiple input validation flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder.
An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the 'lp' user if the
file was printed. (CVE-2009-0800)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
discovered in the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) decoding routines
used by the CUPS image-converting filters, 'imagetops' and
'imagetoraster'. An attacker could create a malicious TIFF file that
could, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the 'lp' user if the
file was printed. (CVE-2009-0163)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder.

bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes :

* a logic error was found in the do_setlk() function of the Linux
kernel Network File System (NFS) implementation. If a signal
interrupted a lock request, the local POSIX lock was incorrectly
created. This could cause a denial of service on the NFS server if a
file descriptor was closed before its corresponding lock request
returned. (CVE-2008-4307, Important)

* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel system call auditing
implementation on 64-bit systems. This could allow a local,
unprivileged user to circumvent a system call audit configuration, if
that configuration filtered based on the 'syscall' number or
arguments. (CVE-2009-0834, Important)

* Chris Evans reported a deficiency in the Linux kernel signals
implementation. The clone() system call permits the caller to indicate
the signal it wants to receive when its child exits. When clone() is
called with the CLONE_PARENT flag, it permits the caller to clone a
new child that shares the same parent as itself, enabling the
indicated signal to be sent to the caller's parent (instead of the
caller), even if the caller's parent has different real and effective
user IDs. This could lead to a denial of service of the parent.
(CVE-2009-0028, Moderate)

* the sock_getsockopt() function in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a data structure that can be directly returned to
user-space when the getsockopt() function is called with SO_BSDCOMPAT
optname set. This flaw could possibly lead to memory disclosure.
(CVE-2009-0676, Moderate)

Bug fixes :

* a kernel crash may have occurred for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7
guests if their guest configuration file specified 'vif = [
'type=ioemu' ]'. This crash only occurred when starting guests via the
'xm create' command. (BZ#477146)

* a bug in IO-APIC NMI watchdog may have prevented Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4.7 from being installed on HP ProLiant DL580 G5 systems. Hangs
during installation and 'NMI received for unknown reason [xx]' errors
may have occurred. (BZ#479184)

* a kernel deadlock on some systems when using netdump through a
network interface that uses the igb driver. (BZ#480579)

* a possible kernel hang in sys_ptrace() on the Itanium(r)
architecture, possibly triggered by tracing a threaded process with
strace. (BZ#484904)

* the RHSA-2008:0665 errata only fixed the known problem with the LSI
Logic LSI53C1030 Ultra320 SCSI controller, for tape devices. Read
commands sent to tape devices may have received incorrect data. This
issue may have led to data corruption. This update includes a fix for
all types of devices. (BZ#487399)

* a missing memory barrier caused a race condition in the AIO
subsystem between the read_events() and aio_complete() functions. This
may have caused a thread in read_events() to sleep indefinitely,
possibly causing an application hang. (BZ#489935)

* due to a lack of synchronization in the NFS client code,
modifications to some pages (for files on an NFS mounted file system)
made through a region of memory mapped by mmap() may be lost if the
NFS client invalidates its page cache for particular files.
(BZ#490119)

* a NULL pointer dereference in the megaraid_mbox driver caused a
system crash on some systems. (BZ#493420)

* the ext3_symlink() function in the ext3 file system code used an
illegal __GFP_FS allocation inside some transactions. This may have
resulted in a kernel panic and 'Assertion failure' errors. (BZ#493422)

* do_machine_check() cleared all Machine Check Exception (MCE) status
registers, preventing the BIOS from using them to determine the cause
of certain panics and errors. (BZ#494915)

* a bug prevented NMI watchdog from initializing on HP ProLiant DL580

available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is
operating correctly.

A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the 'ANY' record type. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to send a specially crafted dynamic update packet that could
cause named to exit with an assertion failure. (CVE-2009-0696)

Note: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving
such a specially crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named
to exit unexpectedly.

This update also fixes the following bug :

* when running on a system receiving a large number of (greater than
4,000) DNS requests per second, the named DNS nameserver became
unresponsive, and the named service had to be restarted in order for
it to continue serving requests. This was caused by a deadlock
occurring between two threads that led to the inability of named to
continue to service requests. This deadlock has been resolved with
these updated packages so that named no longer becomes unresponsive
under heavy load. (BZ#512668)

All BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing
the update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.","Update the affected bind packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?e7ee78f9

The XML Security Library is a C library based on libxml2 and OpenSSL.
It implements the XML Signature Syntax and Processing and XML
Encryption Syntax and Processing standards. HMAC is used for message
authentication using cryptographic hash functions. The HMAC algorithm
allows the hash output to be truncated (as documented in RFC 2104).

A missing check for the recommended minimum length of the truncated
form of HMAC-based XML signatures was found in xmlsec1. An attacker

for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

Newt is a programming library for color text mode, widget-based user
interfaces. Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry widgets,
checkboxes, radio buttons, labels, plain text fields, scrollbars, and
so on, to text mode user interfaces.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way newt processes
content that is to be displayed in a text dialog box. A local attacker
could issue a specially crafted text dialog box display request
(direct or via a custom application), leading to a denial of service
(application crash) or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running the application using the newt library.
(CVE-2009-2905)

Users of newt should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the updated
packages, all applications using the newt library must be restarted

bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* multiple, missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux
kernel. Padding data in several core network structures was not
initialized properly before being sent to user-space. These flaws
could lead to information leaks. (CVE-2005-4881, CVE-2009-3228,
Moderate)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* a packet duplication issue was fixed via the RHSA-2008:0665 update;
however, the fix introduced a problem for systems using network
bonding: Backup slaves were unable to receive ARP packets. When using
network bonding in the 'active-backup' mode and with the
'arp_validate=3' option, the bonding driver considered such backup
slaves as being down (since they were not receiving ARP packets),
preventing successful failover to these devices. (BZ#519384)

* due to insufficient memory barriers in the network code, a process
sleeping in select() may have missed notifications about new data. In
rare cases, this bug may have caused a process to sleep forever.
(BZ#519386)

* the driver version number in the ata_piix driver was not changed
between Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8,
even though changes had been made between these releases. This could
have prevented the driver from loading on systems that check driver
versions, as this driver appeared older than it was. (BZ#519389)

* a bug in nlm_lookup_host() could have led to un-reclaimed locks on
file systems, resulting in the umount command failing. This bug could
have also prevented NFS services from being relocated correctly in
clustered environments. (BZ#519656)

* the data buffer ethtool_get_strings() allocated, for the igb driver,
was smaller than the amount of data that was copied in
igb_get_strings(), because of a miscalculation in IGB_QUEUE_STATS_LEN,
resulting in memory corruption. This bug could have led to a kernel
panic. (BZ#522738)

* in some situations, write operations to a TTY device were blocked
even when the O_NONBLOCK flag was used. A reported case of this issue
occurred when a single TTY device was opened by two users (one using
blocking mode, and the other using non-blocking mode). (BZ#523930)

* a deadlock was found in the cciss driver. In rare cases, this caused
an NMI lockup during boot. Messages such as 'cciss: controller
cciss[x] failed, stopping.' and 'cciss[x]: controller not responding.'
may have been displayed on the console. (BZ#525725)

* on 64-bit PowerPC systems, a rollover bug in the ibmveth driver
could have caused a kernel panic. In a reported case, this panic
occurred on a system with a large uptime and under heavy network load.
(BZ#527225)

backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be

Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files,
printers, and other information.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Samba smbd daemon. An
authenticated, remote user could send a specially crafted response
that would cause an smbd child process to enter an infinite loop. An
authenticated, remote user could use this flaw to exhaust system
resources by opening multiple CIFS sessions. (CVE-2009-2906)

An uninitialized data access flaw was discovered in the smbd daemon
when using the non-default 'dos filemode' configuration option in
'smb.conf'. An authenticated, remote user with write access to a file
could possibly use this flaw to change an access control list for that
file, even when such access should have been denied. (CVE-2009-1888)

A flaw was discovered in the way Samba handled users without a home
directory set in the back-end password database (e.g. '/etc/passwd').
If a share for the home directory of such a user was created (e.g.
using the automated '[homes]' share), any user able to access that
share could see the whole file system, possibly bypassing intended
access restrictions. (CVE-2009-2813)

output when running in verbose mode. When mount.cifs had the setuid
bit set, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to disclose
passwords from a file that would otherwise be inaccessible to that

Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files,
printers, and other information.

A denial of service flaw was found in the Samba smbd daemon. An
authenticated, remote user could send a specially crafted response
that would cause an smbd child process to enter an infinite loop. An
authenticated, remote user could use this flaw to exhaust system
resources by opening multiple CIFS sessions. (CVE-2009-2906)

An uninitialized data access flaw was discovered in the smbd daemon
when using the non-default 'dos filemode' configuration option in
'smb.conf'. An authenticated, remote user with write access to a file
could possibly use this flaw to change an access control list for that
file, even when such access should have been denied. (CVE-2009-1888)

A flaw was discovered in the way Samba handled users without a home
directory set in the back-end password database (e.g. '/etc/passwd').
If a share for the home directory of such a user was created (e.g.
using the automated '[homes]' share), any user able to access that
share could see the whole file system, possibly bypassing intended
access restrictions. (CVE-2009-2813)

The mount.cifs program printed CIFS passwords as part of its debug
output when running in verbose mode. When mount.cifs had the setuid
bit set, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to disclose
passwords from a file that would otherwise be inaccessible to that
user. Note: mount.cifs from the samba packages distributed by Red Hat

bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux
kernel. pci_unmap_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to
IOMMU space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local
network could trigger this flaw by using jumbo frames for large
amounts of network traffic. (CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the
Linux kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state
was initialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker
could use these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,
32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910,
Moderate)

* the unix_stream_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check
if a UNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to
a deadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* an iptables rule with the recent module and a hit count value
greater than the ip_pkt_list_tot parameter (the default is 20), did
not have any effect over packets, as the hit count could not be
reached. (BZ#529306)

* in environments that use dual-controller storage devices with the
cciss driver, Device-Mapper Multipath maps could not be detected and
configured, due to the cciss driver not exporting the bus attribute
via sysfs. This attribute is now exported. (BZ#529309)

* the kernel crashed with a divide error when a certain joystick was
attached. (BZ#532027)

* a bug in the mptctl_do_mpt_command() function in the mpt driver may
have resulted in crashes during boot on i386 systems with certain
adapters using the mpt driver, and also running the hugemem kernel.
(BZ#533798)

* on certain hardware, the igb driver was unable to detect link
statuses correctly. This may have caused problems for network bonding,
such as failover not occurring. (BZ#534105)

* the RHSA-2009:1024 update introduced a regression. After updating to
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 and rebooting, network links often failed
to be brought up for interfaces using the forcedeth driver. 'no link
during initialization' messages may have been logged. (BZ#534112)

* the RHSA-2009:1024 update introduced a second regression. On certain
systems, PS/2 keyboards failed to work. (BZ#537344)

* a bug in checksum offload calculations could have crashed the bnx2x
firmware when the iptable_nat module was loaded, causing network
traffic to stop. (BZ#537013)

* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that the
routing table data structure, rt, is not NULL, to help prevent future
bugs in functions that call ip_append_data() from being exploitable.
(BZ#537016)

* possible kernel pointer dereferences on systems with several NFS
mounts (a mixture of '-o lock' and '-o nolock'), which in rare cases
may have caused a system crash, have been resolved. (BZ#537017)

[Updated 18th January 2008] The original packages distributed with
this errata had a bug which could cause some X applications to fail on
32-bit platforms. We have updated the packages to correct this bug.

The xorg-x11 packages contain X.Org, an open source implementation of
the X Window System. It provides the basic low-level functionality
that full-fledged graphical user interfaces are designed upon.

Two integer overflow flaws were found in the X.Org server's EVI and
MIT-SHM modules. A malicious authorized client could exploit these
issues to cause a denial of service (crash), or potentially execute
arbitrary code with root privileges on the X.Org server.
(CVE-2007-6429)

A heap based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the X.Org
server handled malformed font files. A malicious local user could
exploit these issues to potentially execute arbitrary code with the

A memory corruption flaw was found in the X.Org server's XInput
extension. A malicious authorized client could exploit this issue to
cause a denial of service (crash), or potentially execute arbitrary

bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated packages fix the following security issues :

* the absence of a protection mechanism when attempting to access a
critical section of code has been found in the Linux kernel open file
descriptors control mechanism, fcntl. This could allow a local
unprivileged user to simultaneously execute code, which would
otherwise be protected against parallel execution. As well, a race
condition when handling locks in the Linux kernel fcntl functionality,
may have allowed a process belonging to a local unprivileged user to
gain re-ordered access to the descriptor table. (CVE-2008-1669,
Important)

* on AMD64 architectures, the possibility of a kernel crash was
discovered by testing the Linux kernel process-trace ability. This
could allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
(kernel crash). (CVE-2008-1615, Important)

* the absence of a protection mechanism when attempting to access a
critical section of code, as well as a race condition, have been found
in the Linux kernel file system event notifier, dnotify. This could
allow a local unprivileged user to get inconsistent data, or to send
arbitrary signals to arbitrary system processes. (CVE-2008-1375,
Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Nick Piggin for responsibly disclosing the
following issue :

* when accessing kernel memory locations, certain Linux kernel drivers
registering a fault handler did not perform required range checks. A
local unprivileged user could use this flaw to gain read or write
access to arbitrary kernel memory, or possibly cause a kernel crash.
(CVE-2008-0007, Important)

* the possibility of a kernel crash was found in the Linux kernel
IPsec protocol implementation, due to improper handling of fragmented
ESP packets. When an attacker controlling an intermediate router
fragmented these packets into very small pieces, it would cause a
kernel crash on the receiving node during packet reassembly.
(CVE-2007-6282, Important)

* a flaw in the MOXA serial driver could allow a local unprivileged
user to perform privileged operations, such as replacing firmware.
(CVE-2005-0504, Important)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bugs :

* multiple buffer overflows in the neofb driver have been resolved. It
was not possible for an unprivileged user to exploit these issues, and
as such, they have not been handled as security issues.

* a kernel panic, due to inconsistent detection of AGP aperture size,
has been resolved.

* a race condition in UNIX domain sockets may have caused 'recv()' to
return zero. In clustered configurations, this may have caused
unexpected failovers.

* to prevent link storms, network link carrier events were delayed by
up to one second, causing unnecessary packet loss. Now, link carrier
events are scheduled immediately.

* a client-side race on blocking locks caused large time delays on NFS
file systems.

* in certain situations, the libATA sata_nv driver may have sent
commands with duplicate tags, which were rejected by SATA devices.
This may have caused infinite reboots.

* running the 'service network restart' command may have caused
networking to fail.

* a bug in NFS caused cached information about directories to be
stored for too long, causing wrong attributes to be read.

* on systems with a large highmem/lowmem ratio, NFS write performance
may have been very slow when using small files.

* a bug, which caused network hangs when the system clock was wrapped
around zero, has been resolved.

bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated packages fix the following security issues :

* the absence of a protection mechanism when attempting to access a
critical section of code has been found in the Linux kernel open file
descriptors control mechanism, fcntl. This could allow a local
unprivileged user to simultaneously execute code, which would
otherwise be protected against parallel execution. As well, a race
condition when handling locks in the Linux kernel fcntl functionality,
may have allowed a process belonging to a local unprivileged user to
gain re-ordered access to the descriptor table. (CVE-2008-1669,
Important)

* on AMD64 architectures, the possibility of a kernel crash was
discovered by testing the Linux kernel process-trace ability. This
could allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
(kernel crash). (CVE-2008-1615, Important)

* the absence of a protection mechanism when attempting to access a
critical section of code, as well as a race condition, have been found
in the Linux kernel file system event notifier, dnotify. This could
allow a local unprivileged user to get inconsistent data, or to send
arbitrary signals to arbitrary system processes. (CVE-2008-1375,
Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Nick Piggin for responsibly disclosing the
following issue :

* when accessing kernel memory locations, certain Linux kernel drivers
registering a fault handler did not perform required range checks. A
local unprivileged user could use this flaw to gain read or write
access to arbitrary kernel memory, or possibly cause a kernel crash.
(CVE-2008-0007, Important)

* the possibility of a kernel crash was found in the Linux kernel
IPsec protocol implementation, due to improper handling of fragmented
ESP packets. When an attacker controlling an intermediate router
fragmented these packets into very small pieces, it would cause a
kernel crash on the receiving node during packet reassembly.
(CVE-2007-6282, Important)

* a flaw in the MOXA serial driver could allow a local unprivileged
user to perform privileged operations, such as replacing firmware.
(CVE-2005-0504, Important)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bugs :

* multiple buffer overflows in the neofb driver have been resolved. It
was not possible for an unprivileged user to exploit these issues, and
as such, they have not been handled as security issues.

* a kernel panic, due to inconsistent detection of AGP aperture size,
has been resolved.

* a race condition in UNIX domain sockets may have caused 'recv()' to
return zero. In clustered configurations, this may have caused
unexpected failovers.

This update addresses the following security issues :

* the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX
socket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local
denial of service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)

* when fput() was called to close a socket, the __scm_destroy()
function in the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to
itself. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial of service.
(CVE-2008-5029, Important)

* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual file system (VFS)
implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to make a
series of file creations within deleted directories, possibly causing
a denial of service. (CVE-2008-3275, Moderate)

* a buffer underflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel IB700 SBC
watchdog timer driver. This deficiency could lead to a possible
information leak. By default, the '/dev/watchdog' device is accessible
only to the root user. (CVE-2008-5702, Low)

* the hfs and hfsplus file systems code failed to properly handle
corrupted data structures. This could, potentially, lead to a local
denial of service. (CVE-2008-4933, CVE-2008-5025, Low)

* a flaw was found in the hfsplus file system implementation. This
could, potentially, lead to a local denial of service when write
operations were performed. (CVE-2008-4934, Low)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* when running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 and 4.7 on some systems
running Intel(r) CPUs, the cpuspeed daemon did not run, preventing the
CPU speed from being changed, such as not being reduced to an idle
state when not in use.

* mmap() could be used to gain access to beyond the first megabyte of
RAM, due to insufficient checks in the Linux kernel code. Checks have
been added to prevent this.

* attempting to turn keyboard LEDs on and off rapidly on keyboards
with slow keyboard controllers, may have caused key presses to fail.

* after migrating a hypervisor guest, the MAC address table was not
updated, causing packet loss and preventing network connections to the
guest. Now, a gratuitous ARP request is sent after migration. This
refreshes the ARP caches, minimizing network downtime.

* writing crash dumps with diskdump may have caused a kernel panic on
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) systems with certain memory
configurations.

* on big-endian systems, such as PowerPC, the getsockopt() function
incorrectly returned 0 depending on the parameters passed to it when
the time to live (TTL) value equaled 255, possibly causing memory
corruption and application crashes.

* a problem in the kernel packages provided by the RHSA-2008:0508
advisory caused the Linux kernel's built-in memory copy procedure to
return the wrong error code after recovering from a page fault on
AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. This may have caused other Linux kernel
functions to return wrong error codes.

* a divide-by-zero bug in the Linux kernel process scheduler, which
may have caused kernel panics on certain systems, has been resolved.

* the netconsole kernel module caused the Linux kernel to hang when
slave interfaces of bonded network interfaces were started, resulting
in a system hang or kernel panic when restarting the network.

* the '/proc/xen/' directory existed even if systems were not running
Red Hat Virtualization. This may have caused problems for third-party
software that checks virtualization-ability based on the existence of
'/proc/xen/'. Note: this update will remove the '/proc/xen/' directory
on systems not running Red Hat Virtualization.

various bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update addresses the following security issues :

* the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX
socket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local
denial of service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)

* when fput() was called to close a socket, the __scm_destroy()
function in the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to
itself. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial of service.
(CVE-2008-5029, Important)

* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual file system (VFS)
implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to make a
series of file creations within deleted directories, possibly causing
a denial of service. (CVE-2008-3275, Moderate)

* a buffer underflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel IB700 SBC
watchdog timer driver. This deficiency could lead to a possible
information leak. By default, the '/dev/watchdog' device is accessible
only to the root user. (CVE-2008-5702, Low)

* the hfs and hfsplus file systems code failed to properly handle
corrupted data structures. This could, potentially, lead to a local
denial of service. (CVE-2008-4933, CVE-2008-5025, Low)

* a flaw was found in the hfsplus file system implementation. This
could, potentially, lead to a local denial of service when write
operations were performed. (CVE-2008-4934, Low)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* when running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 and 4.7 on some systems
running Intel(r) CPUs, the cpuspeed daemon did not run, preventing the
CPU speed from being changed, such as not being reduced to an idle
state when not in use.

* mmap() could be used to gain access to beyond the first megabyte of
RAM, due to insufficient checks in the Linux kernel code. Checks have
been added to prevent this.

* attempting to turn keyboard LEDs on and off rapidly on keyboards
with slow keyboard controllers, may have caused key presses to fail.

* after migrating a hypervisor guest, the MAC address table was not
updated, causing packet loss and preventing network connections to the
guest. Now, a gratuitous ARP request is sent after migration. This
refreshes the ARP caches, minimizing network downtime.

* writing crash dumps with diskdump may have caused a kernel panic on
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) systems with certain memory
configurations.

* on big-endian systems, such as PowerPC, the getsockopt() function
incorrectly returned 0 depending on the parameters passed to it when
the time to live (TTL) value equaled 255, possibly causing memory
corruption and application crashes.

* a problem in the kernel packages provided by the RHSA-2008:0508
advisory caused the Linux kernel's built-in memory copy procedure to
return the wrong error code after recovering from a page fault on
AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. This may have caused other Linux kernel
functions to return wrong error codes.

* a divide-by-zero bug in the Linux kernel process scheduler, which
may have caused kernel panics on certain systems, has been resolved.

* the netconsole kernel module caused the Linux kernel to hang when
slave interfaces of bonded network interfaces were started, resulting
in a system hang or kernel panic when restarting the network.

* the '/proc/xen/' directory existed even if systems were not running
Red Hat Virtualization. This may have caused problems for third-party
software that checks virtualization-ability based on the existence of
'/proc/xen/'. Note: this update will remove the '/proc/xen/' directory
on systems not running Red Hat Virtualization.

various bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update addresses the following security issues :

* a buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel Partial Reliable
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (PR-SCTP) implementation. This
could, potentially, lead to a denial of service if a Forward-TSN chunk
is received with a large stream ID. (CVE-2009-0065, Important)

* a memory leak was found in keyctl handling. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to deplete kernel memory, eventually leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2009-0031, Important)

* a deficiency was found in the Remote BIOS Update (RBU) driver for
Dell systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a
denial of service by reading zero bytes from the image_type or
packet_size file in '/sys/devices/platform/dell_rbu/'. (CVE-2009-0322,
Important)

* a deficiency was found in the libATA implementation. This could,
potentially, lead to a denial of service. Note: by default, '/dev/sg*'
devices are accessible only to the root user. (CVE-2008-5700, Low)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* when the hypervisor changed a page table entry (pte) mapping from
read-only to writable via a make_writable hypercall, accessing the
changed page immediately following the change caused a spurious page
fault. When trying to install a para-virtualized Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4 guest on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 dom0 host, this fault
crashed the installer with a kernel backtrace. With this update, the
'spurious' page fault is handled properly. (BZ#483748)

* net_rx_action could detect its cpu poll_list as non-empty, but have
that same list reduced to empty by the poll_napi path. This resulted
in garbage data being returned when net_rx_action calls list_entry,
which subsequently resulted in several possible crash conditions. The
race condition in the network code which caused this has been fixed.
(BZ#475970, BZ#479681 & BZ#480741)

* a misplaced memory barrier at unlock_buffer() could lead to a
concurrent h_refcounter update which produced a reference counter leak
and, later, a double free in ext3_xattr_release_block(). Consequent to
the double free, ext3 reported an error

ext3_free_blocks_sb: bit already cleared for block [block number]

and mounted itself as read-only. With this update, the memory barrier
is now placed before the buffer head lock bit, forcing the write order
and preventing the double free. (BZ#476533)

* when the iptables module was unloaded, it was assumed the correct
entry for removal had been found if 'wrapper->ops->pf' matched the
value passed in by 'reg->pf'. If several ops ranges were registered
against the same protocol family, however, (which was likely if you
had both ip_conntrack and ip_contrack_* loaded) this assumption could
lead to NULL list pointers and cause a kernel panic. With this update,
'wrapper->ops' is matched to pointer values 'reg', which ensures the
correct entry is removed and results in no NULL list pointers.
(BZ#477147)

* when the pidmap page (used for tracking process ids, pids)
incremented to an even page (ie the second, fourth, sixth, etc. pidmap
page), the alloc_pidmap() routine skipped the page. This resulted in
'holes' in the allocated pids. For example, after pid 32767, you would
expect 32768 to be allocated. If the page skipping behavior presented,
however, the pid allocated after 32767 was 65536. With this update,
alloc_pidmap() no longer skips alternate pidmap pages and allocated
pid holes no longer occur. This fix also corrects an error which
allowed pid_max to be set higher than the pid_max limit has been
corrected. (BZ#479182)

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags were not cleared
when a setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection
mechanism and perform a NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature.
(CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the
clear_child_tid pointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this
pointer points to a writable portion of the memory of the new program,
the kernel could corrupt four bytes of memory, possibly leading to a
local denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848,
Important)

* Solar Designer reported a missing capability check in the z90crypt
driver in the Linux kernel. This missing check could allow a local
user with an effective user ID (euid) of 0 to bypass intended
capability restrictions. (CVE-2009-1883, Moderate)

* a flaw was found in the way the do_sigaltstack() function in the
Linux kernel copies the stack_t structure to user-space. On 64-bit
machines, this flaw could lead to a four-byte information leak.
(CVE-2009-2847, Moderate)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* the gcc flag '-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks' was added to the
kernel build options. This prevents gcc from optimizing out NULL
pointer checks after the first use of a pointer. NULL pointer bugs are
often exploited by attackers. Keeping these checks is a safety
measure. (BZ#517964)

* the Emulex LPFC driver has been updated to version 8.0.16.47, which
fixes a memory leak that caused memory allocation failures and system
hangs. (BZ#513192)

* an error in the MPT Fusion driver makefile caused CSMI ioctls to not
work with Serial Attached SCSI devices. (BZ#516184)

* this update adds the mmap_min_addr tunable and restriction checks to
help prevent unprivileged users from creating new memory mappings
below the minimum address. This can help prevent the exploitation of
NULL pointer deference bugs. Note that mmap_min_addr is set to zero
(disabled) by default for backwards compatibility. (BZ#517904)

* time-outs resulted in I/O errors being logged to '/var/log/messages'
when running 'mt erase' on tape drives using certain LSI MegaRAID SAS
adapters, preventing the command from completing. The megaraid_sas
driver's timeout value is now set to the OS layer value. (BZ#517965)

* a locking issue caused the qla2xxx ioctl module to hang after
encountering errors. This locking issue has been corrected. This ioctl
module is used by the QLogic SAN management tools, such as SANsurfer
and scli. (BZ#519428)

* when a RAID 1 array that uses the mptscsi driver and the LSI 1030
controller became degraded, the whole array was detected as being
offline, which could cause kernel panics at boot or data loss.
(BZ#517295)

* on 32-bit architectures, if a file was held open and frequently
written for more than 25 days, it was possible that the kernel would
stop flushing those writes to storage. (BZ#515255)

* a memory allocation bug in ib_mthca prevented the driver from
loading if it was loaded with large values for the 'num_mpt=' and
'num_mtt=' options. (BZ#518707)

* with this update, get_random_int() is more random and no longer uses
a common seed value, reducing the possibility of predicting the values
returned. (BZ#519692)

* a bug in __ptrace_unlink() caused it to create deadlocked and
unkillable processes. (BZ#519446)

* previously, multiple threads using the fcntl() F_SETLK command to
synchronize file access caused a deadlock in posix_locks_deadlock().

"43790","CVE-2009-3238","7.8","High","192.168.0.142","tcp","0","CentOS 4 : kernel (CESA-2009:1438)","The remote CentOS host is missing one or more security updates.","Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags were not cleared
when a setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection
mechanism and perform a NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature.
(CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the
clear_child_tid pointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this
pointer points to a writable portion of the memory of the new program,
the kernel could corrupt four bytes of memory, possibly leading to a
local denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848,
Important)

* Solar Designer reported a missing capability check in the z90crypt
driver in the Linux kernel. This missing check could allow a local
user with an effective user ID (euid) of 0 to bypass intended
capability restrictions. (CVE-2009-1883, Moderate)

* a flaw was found in the way the do_sigaltstack() function in the
Linux kernel copies the stack_t structure to user-space. On 64-bit
machines, this flaw could lead to a four-byte information leak.
(CVE-2009-2847, Moderate)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* the gcc flag '-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks' was added to the
kernel build options. This prevents gcc from optimizing out NULL
pointer checks after the first use of a pointer. NULL pointer bugs are
often exploited by attackers. Keeping these checks is a safety
measure. (BZ#517964)

* the Emulex LPFC driver has been updated to version 8.0.16.47, which
fixes a memory leak that caused memory allocation failures and system
hangs. (BZ#513192)

* an error in the MPT Fusion driver makefile caused CSMI ioctls to not
work with Serial Attached SCSI devices. (BZ#516184)

* this update adds the mmap_min_addr tunable and restriction checks to
help prevent unprivileged users from creating new memory mappings
below the minimum address. This can help prevent the exploitation of
NULL pointer deference bugs. Note that mmap_min_addr is set to zero
(disabled) by default for backwards compatibility. (BZ#517904)

* time-outs resulted in I/O errors being logged to '/var/log/messages'
when running 'mt erase' on tape drives using certain LSI MegaRAID SAS
adapters, preventing the command from completing. The megaraid_sas
driver's timeout value is now set to the OS layer value. (BZ#517965)

* a locking issue caused the qla2xxx ioctl module to hang after
encountering errors. This locking issue has been corrected. This ioctl
module is used by the QLogic SAN management tools, such as SANsurfer
and scli. (BZ#519428)

* when a RAID 1 array that uses the mptscsi driver and the LSI 1030
controller became degraded, the whole array was detected as being
offline, which could cause kernel panics at boot or data loss.
(BZ#517295)

* on 32-bit architectures, if a file was held open and frequently
written for more than 25 days, it was possible that the kernel would
stop flushing those writes to storage. (BZ#515255)

* a memory allocation bug in ib_mthca prevented the driver from
loading if it was loaded with large values for the 'num_mpt=' and
'num_mtt=' options. (BZ#518707)

* with this update, get_random_int() is more random and no longer uses
a common seed value, reducing the possibility of predicting the values
returned. (BZ#519692)

* a bug in __ptrace_unlink() caused it to create deadlocked and
unkillable processes. (BZ#519446)

* previously, multiple threads using the fcntl() F_SETLK command to
synchronize file access caused a deadlock in posix_locks_deadlock().
This could cause a system hang. (BZ#519429)

Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
trusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

Multiple integer underflow flaws, leading to heap-based corruption,
were found in the way the MIT Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
decrypted ciphertexts encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES) and ARCFOUR (RC4) encryption algorithms. If a remote KDC client
were able to provide a specially crafted AES- or RC4-encrypted
ciphertext or texts, it could potentially lead to either a denial of
service of the central KDC (KDC crash or abort upon processing the
crafted ciphertext), or arbitrary code execution with the privileges
of the KDC (i.e., root privileges). (CVE-2009-4212)

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the
Apache HTTP Web server.

Multiple missing input sanitization flaws were discovered in PHP's
exif extension. A specially crafted image file could cause the PHP
interpreter to crash or, possibly, disclose portions of its memory
when a PHP script tried to extract Exchangeable image file format
(Exif) metadata from the image file. (CVE-2009-2687, CVE-2009-3292)

discovered in PHP's gd library. A specially crafted GD image file
could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-3546)

It was discovered that PHP did not limit the maximum number of files
that can be uploaded in one request. A remote attacker could use this
flaw to instigate a denial of service by causing the PHP interpreter
to use lots of system resources dealing with requests containing large
amounts of files to be uploaded. This vulnerability depends on file
uploads being enabled (which it is, in the default PHP configuration).
(CVE-2009-4017)

Note: This update introduces a new configuration option,
max_file_uploads, used for limiting the number of files that can be
uploaded in one request. By default, the limit is 20 files per
request.

It was discovered that PHP was affected by the previously published
'null prefix attack', caused by incorrect handling of NUL characters
in X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get a
carefully-crafted certificate signed by a trusted Certificate
Authority, the attacker could use the certificate during a
man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse PHP into accepting it
by mistake. (CVE-2009-3291)

It was discovered that PHP's htmlspecialchars() function did not
properly recognize partial multi-byte sequences for some multi-byte

bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* an array index error was found in the gdth driver in the Linux
kernel. A local user could send a specially crafted IOCTL request that
would cause a denial of service or, possibly, privilege escalation.
(CVE-2009-3080, Important)

* a flaw was found in the collect_rx_frame() function in the HiSax
ISDN driver (hfc_usb) in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this
flaw to send a specially crafted HDLC packet that could trigger a
buffer out of bounds, possibly resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4005, Important)

* permission issues were found in the megaraid_sas driver (for SAS
based RAID controllers) in the Linux kernel. The 'dbg_lvl' and
'poll_mode_io' files on the sysfs file system ('/sys/') had
world-writable permissions. This could allow local, unprivileged users
to change the behavior of the driver. (CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939,
Moderate)

* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs_bnode_read() function in
the HFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel. This could
lead to a denial of service if a user browsed a specially crafted HFS
file system, for example, by running 'ls'. (CVE-2009-4020, Low)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* if a process was using ptrace() to trace a multi-threaded process,
and that multi-threaded process dumped its core, the process
performing the trace could hang in wait4(). This issue could be
triggered by running 'strace -f' on a multi-threaded process that was
dumping its core, resulting in the strace command hanging. (BZ#555869)

* a bug in the ptrace() implementation could have, in some cases,
caused ptrace_detach() to create a zombie process if the process being
traced was terminated with a SIGKILL signal. (BZ#555869)

Red Hat Security Response Team.

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists
of the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and
libraries.

Multiple flaws were discovered in the way MySQL handled symbolic links
to tables created using the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY
directives in CREATE TABLE statements. An attacker with CREATE and
DROP table privileges and shell access to the database server could
use these flaws to escalate their database privileges, or gain access
to tables created by other database users. (CVE-2008-4098,
CVE-2009-4030)

Note: Due to the security risks and previous security issues related
to the use of the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives, users
not depending on this feature should consider disabling it by adding
'symbolic-links=0' to the '[mysqld]' section of the 'my.cnf'
configuration file. In this update, an example of such a configuration
was added to the default 'my.cnf' file.

An insufficient HTML entities quoting flaw was found in the mysql
command line client's HTML output mode. If an attacker was able to
inject arbitrary HTML tags into data stored in a MySQL database, which
was later retrieved using the mysql command line client and its HTML
output mode, they could perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
against victims viewing the HTML output in a web browser.
(CVE-2008-4456)

Multiple format string flaws were found in the way the MySQL server
logged user commands when creating and deleting databases. A remote,
authenticated attacker with permissions to CREATE and DROP databases
could use these flaws to formulate a specially crafted SQL command
that would cause a temporary denial of service (open connections to
mysqld are terminated). (CVE-2009-2446)

Note: To exploit the CVE-2009-2446 flaws, the general query log (the
mysqld '--log' command line option or the 'log' option in 'my.cnf')
must be enabled. This logging is not enabled by default.

All MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,

for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

SystemTap is an instrumentation system for systems running the Linux
kernel, version 2.6. Developers can write scripts to collect data on
the operation of the system.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in SystemTap's tapset __get_argv()
function. If a privileged user ran a SystemTap script that called this
function, a local, unprivileged user could, while that script is still
running, trigger this flaw and cause memory corruption by running a
command with a large argument list, which may lead to a system crash
or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
(CVE-2010-0411)

Note: SystemTap scripts that call __get_argv(), being a privileged
function, can only be executed by the root user or users in the
stapdev group. As well, if such a script was compiled and installed by
root, users in the stapusr group would also be able to execute it.

SystemTap users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.","Update the affected systemtap packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?af816a24

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb()
function in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially
crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2010-0008, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel.
During a core dump, the kernel did not check if the Virtual
Dynamically-linked Shared Object page was accessible. On Intel 64 and
AMD64 systems, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause
a kernel panic by running a crafted 32-bit application.
(CVE-2009-4271, Important)

* an information leak was found in the print_fatal_signal()
implementation in the Linux kernel. When
'/proc/sys/kernel/print-fatal-signals' is set to 1 (the default value
is 0), memory that is reachable by the kernel could be leaked to
user-space. This issue could also result in a system crash. Note that
this flaw only affected the i386 architecture. (CVE-2010-0003,
Moderate)

* on AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure
the ELF interpreter was available before making a call to the
SET_PERSONALITY macro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a
denial of service by running a 32-bit application that attempts to
execute a 64-bit application. (CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)

* missing capability checks were found in the ebtables implementation,
used for creating an Ethernet bridge firewall. This could allow a
local, unprivileged user to bypass intended capability restrictions
and modify ebtables rules. (CVE-2010-0007, Low)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* under some circumstances, a locking bug could have caused an online
ext3 file system resize to deadlock, which may have, in turn, caused
the file system or the entire system to become unresponsive. In either
case, a reboot was required after the deadlock. With this update,
using resize2fs to perform an online resize of an ext3 file system
works as expected. (BZ#553135)

* some ATA and SCSI devices were not honoring the barrier=1 mount
option, which could result in data loss after a crash or power loss.
This update applies a patch to the Linux SCSI driver to ensure ordered
write caching. This solution does not provide cache flushes; however,
it does provide data integrity on devices that have no write caching
(or where write caching is disabled) and no command queuing. For
systems that have command queuing or write cache enabled there is no
guarantee of data integrity after a crash. (BZ#560563)

* it was found that lpfc_find_target() could loop continuously when
scanning a list of nodes due to a missing spinlock. This missing
spinlock allowed the list to be changed after the list_empty() test,
resulting in a NULL value, causing the loop. This update adds the
spinlock, resolving the issue. (BZ#561453)

* the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0020 introduced a
regression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb()
function in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially
crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2010-0008, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel.
During a core dump, the kernel did not check if the Virtual
Dynamically-linked Shared Object page was accessible. On Intel 64 and
AMD64 systems, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause
a kernel panic by running a crafted 32-bit application.
(CVE-2009-4271, Important)

* an information leak was found in the print_fatal_signal()
implementation in the Linux kernel. When
'/proc/sys/kernel/print-fatal-signals' is set to 1 (the default value
is 0), memory that is reachable by the kernel could be leaked to
user-space. This issue could also result in a system crash. Note that
this flaw only affected the i386 architecture. (CVE-2010-0003,
Moderate)

* on AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure
the ELF interpreter was available before making a call to the
SET_PERSONALITY macro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a
denial of service by running a 32-bit application that attempts to
execute a 64-bit application. (CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)

* missing capability checks were found in the ebtables implementation,
used for creating an Ethernet bridge firewall. This could allow a
local, unprivileged user to bypass intended capability restrictions
and modify ebtables rules. (CVE-2010-0007, Low)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* under some circumstances, a locking bug could have caused an online
ext3 file system resize to deadlock, which may have, in turn, caused
the file system or the entire system to become unresponsive. In either
case, a reboot was required after the deadlock. With this update,
using resize2fs to perform an online resize of an ext3 file system
works as expected. (BZ#553135)

* some ATA and SCSI devices were not honoring the barrier=1 mount
option, which could result in data loss after a crash or power loss.
This update applies a patch to the Linux SCSI driver to ensure ordered
write caching. This solution does not provide cache flushes; however,
it does provide data integrity on devices that have no write caching
(or where write caching is disabled) and no command queuing. For
systems that have command queuing or write cache enabled there is no
guarantee of data integrity after a crash. (BZ#560563)

* it was found that lpfc_find_target() could loop continuously when
scanning a list of nodes due to a missing spinlock. This missing
spinlock allowed the list to be changed after the list_empty() test,
resulting in a NULL value, causing the loop. This update adds the
spinlock, resolving the issue. (BZ#561453)

* the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0020 introduced a
regression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices
using the Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure
WoL for such devices resulted in the following error, even when
configuring valid options :

'Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported not
setting wol'

This update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected
for network devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#565496)

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes :

* RHSA-2009:1024 introduced a flaw in the ptrace implementation on
Itanium systems. ptrace_check_attach() was not called during certain
ptrace() requests. Under certain circumstances, a local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to call ptrace() on a process they do not
own, giving them control over that process. (CVE-2010-0729, Important)

* a flaw was found in the kernel's Unidirectional Lightweight
Encapsulation (ULE) implementation. A remote attacker could send a
specially crafted ISO MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) frame to a target
system, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1086, Important)

* a use-after-free flaw was found in tcp_rcv_state_process() in the
kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using IPv6
had the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote
attacker could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel
panic. (CVE-2010-1188, Important)

* a divide-by-zero flaw was found in azx_position_ok() in the Intel
High Definition Audio driver, snd-hda-intel. A local, unprivileged
user could trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2010-1085, Moderate)

* an information leak flaw was found in the kernel's USB
implementation. Certain USB errors could result in an uninitialized
kernel buffer being sent to user-space. An attacker with physical
access to a target system could use this flaw to cause an information
leak. (CVE-2010-1083, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Ang Way Chuang for reporting
CVE-2010-1086.

Bug fixes :

* a regression prevented the Broadcom BCM5761 network device from
working when in the first (top) PCI-E slot of Hewlett-Packard (HP)
Z600 systems. Note: The card worked in the 2nd or 3rd PCI-E slot.
(BZ#567205)

* the Xen hypervisor supports 168 GB of RAM for 32-bit guests. The
physical address range was set incorrectly, however, causing 32-bit,
para-virtualized Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 guests to crash when
launched on AMD64 or Intel 64 hosts that have more than 64 GB of RAM.
(BZ#574392)

* RHSA-2009:1024 introduced a regression, causing diskdump to fail on
systems with certain adapters using the qla2xxx driver. (BZ#577234)

* a race condition caused TX to stop in a guest using the virtio_net
driver. (BZ#580089)

* on some systems, using the 'arp_validate=3' bonding option caused
both links to show as 'down' even though the arp_target was responding
to ARP requests sent by the bonding driver. (BZ#580842)

* in some circumstances, when a Red Hat Enterprise Linux client
connected to a re-booted Windows-based NFS server, server-side
filehandle-to-inode mapping changes caused a kernel panic.
'bad_inode_ops' handling was changed to prevent this. Note:
filehandle-to-inode mapping changes may still cause errors, but not
panics. (BZ#582908)

* when installing a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 guest via PXE,
hard-coded fixed-size scatterlists could conflict with host requests,
causing the guest's kernel to panic. With this update, dynamically
allocated scatterlists are used, resolving this issue. (BZ#582911)

Enhancements :

* kernel support for connlimit. Note: iptables errata update
RHBA-2010:0395 is also required for connlimit to work correctly.
(BZ#563223)

* support for the Intel architectural performance monitoring subsystem
(arch_perfmon). On supported CPUs, arch_perfmon offers means to mark
performance events and options for configuring and counting these
events. (BZ#582913)

* kernel support for OProfile sampling of Intel microarchitecture
(Nehalem) CPUs. This update alone does not address OProfile support
for such CPUs. A future oprofile package update will allow OProfile to
work on Intel Nehalem CPUs. (BZ#582241)

backported patches to correct these issues and add these enhancements.

RHBA-2010:0395 is also required for connlimit to work correctly.
(BZ#563223)

* support for the Intel architectural performance monitoring subsystem

performance events and options for configuring and counting these
events. (BZ#582913)

* kernel support for OProfile sampling of Intel microarchitecture

A missing memory allocation failure check flaw, leading to a NULL
pointer dereference, was found in the CUPS 'texttops' filter. An
attacker could create a malicious text file that would cause
'texttops' to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the
'lp' user if the file was printed. (CVE-2010-0542)

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue was found in the CUPS web
interface. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who is logged into
the CUPS web interface as an administrator, into visiting a specially
crafted website, the attacker could reconfigure and disable CUPS, and
gain access to print jobs and system files. (CVE-2010-0540)

Note: As a result of the fix for CVE-2010-0540, cookies must now be
enabled in your web browser to use the CUPS web interface.

An uninitialized memory read issue was found in the CUPS web
interface. If an attacker had access to the CUPS web interface, they
could use a specially crafted URL to leverage this flaw to read a
limited amount of memory from the cupsd process, possibly obtaining
sensitive information. (CVE-2010-1748)

Two stack overflow flaws were found in the way the FreeType font
engine processed certain Compact Font Format (CFF) character strings
(opcodes). If a user loaded a specially crafted font file with an
application linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application. (CVE-2010-1797)

Red Hat would like to thank Braden Thomas of the Apple Product
Security team for reporting these issues.

Note: CVE-2010-1797 only affects the FreeType 2 font engine.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
a backported patch to correct these issues. The X server must be
restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.","Update the affected freetype packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?f3cae0a7

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux

Security fixes :

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel NFSv4
implementation. Several of the NFSv4 file locking functions failed to
check whether a file had been opened on the server before performing
locking operations on it. A local, unprivileged user on a system with
an NFSv4 share mounted could possibly use this flaw to cause a kernel
panic (denial of service) or escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2009-3726, Important)

* a flaw was found in the sctp_process_unk_param() function in the
Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted SCTP
packet to an SCTP listening port on a target system, causing a kernel
panic (denial of service). (CVE-2010-1173, Important)

for responsibly reporting CVE-2010-1173.

Bug fixes :

* RHBA-2007:0791 introduced a regression in the Journaling Block
Device (JBD). Under certain circumstances, removing a large file (such
as 300 MB or more) did not result in inactive memory being freed,
leading to the system having a large amount of inactive memory. Now,
the memory is correctly freed. (BZ#589155)

* the timer_interrupt() routine did not scale lost real ticks to
logical ticks correctly, possibly causing time drift for 64-bit Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 4 KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) guests that
were booted with the 'divider=x' kernel parameter set to a value
greater than 1. 'warning: many lost ticks' messages may have been
logged on the affected guest systems. (BZ#590551)

* a bug could have prevented NFSv3 clients from having the most
up-to-date file attributes for files on a given NFSv3 file system. In
cases where a file type changed, such as if a file was removed and
replaced with a directory of the same name, the NFSv3 client may not
have noticed this change until stat(2) was called (for example, by
running 'ls -l'). (BZ#596372)

* RHBA-2007:0791 introduced bugs in the Linux kernel PCI-X subsystem.
These could have caused a system deadlock on some systems where the
BIOS set the default Maximum Memory Read Byte Count (MMRBC) to 4096,
and that also use the Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000. Errors such
as 'e1000: eth[x]: e1000_clean_tx_irq: Detected Tx Unit Hang' were
logged. (BZ#596374)

* an out of memory condition in a KVM guest, using the virtio-net
network driver and also under heavy network stress, could have
resulted in that guest being unable to receive network traffic. Users
had to manually remove and re-add the virtio_net module and restart
the network service before networking worked as expected. Such memory
conditions no longer prevent KVM guests receiving network traffic.
(BZ#597310)

* when an SFQ qdisc that limited the queue size to two packets was
added to a network interface, sending traffic through that interface
resulted in a kernel crash. Such a qdisc no longer results in a kernel
crash. (BZ#597312)

* when an NFS client opened a file with the O_TRUNC flag set, it
received a valid stateid, but did not use that stateid to perform the
SETATTR call. Such cases were rejected by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
NFS servers with an 'NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID' error, possibly preventing
some NFS clients from writing files to an NFS file system. (BZ#597314)

It was discovered that the FreeType font rendering engine improperly
validated certain position values when processing input streams. If a
user loaded a specially crafted font file with an application linked
against FreeType, and the relevant font glyphs were subsequently
rendered with the X FreeType library (libXft), it could trigger a
heap-based buffer overflow in the libXft library, causing the
application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2010-3311)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType
font rendering engine processed some PostScript Type 1 fonts. If a
user loaded a specially crafted font file with an application linked
against FreeType, it could cause the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application. (CVE-2010-2808)

An array index error was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed certain PostScript Type 42 font files. If a user
loaded a specially crafted font file with an application linked
against FreeType, it could cause the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application. (CVE-2010-2806)

an information leak. (CVE-2010-3477, Moderate)

* A missing upper bound integer check was found in the sys_io_submit()

* When two systems using bonding devices in the adaptive load
balancing (ALB) mode communicated with each other, an endless loop of
ARP replies started between these two systems due to a faulty MAC
address update. With this update, the MAC address update no longer
creates unneeded ARP replies. (BZ#629239)

* When running the Connectathon NFS Testsuite with certain clients and
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 as the server, nfsvers4, lock, and test2
failed the Connectathon test. (BZ#625535)

* For UDP/UNIX domain sockets, due to insufficient memory barriers in
the network code, a process sleeping in select() may have missed
notifications about new data. In rare cases, this bug may have caused
a process to sleep forever. (BZ#640117)

* In certain situations, a bug found in either the HTB or TBF network
packet schedulers in the Linux kernel could have caused a kernel panic
when using Broadcom network cards with the bnx2 driver. (BZ#624363)

* Previously, allocating fallback cqr for DASD reserve/release IOCTLs
failed because it used the memory pool of the respective device. This
update preallocates sufficient memory for a single reserve/release
request. (BZ#626828)

* In some situations a bug prevented 'force online' succeeding for a
DASD device. (BZ#626827)

* Using the 'fsstress' utility may have caused a kernel panic.
(BZ#633968)

* This update introduces additional stack guard patches. (BZ#632515)

* A bug was found in the way the megaraid_sas driver handled physical
disks and management IOCTLs. All physical disks were exported to the
disk layer, allowing an oops in megasas_complete_cmd_dpc() when
completing the IOCTL command if a timeout occurred. (BZ#631903)

* Previously, a warning message was returned when a large amount of

bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for
each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* Information leak flaws were found in the Linux kernel Traffic
Control Unit implementation. A local attacker could use these flaws to
cause the kernel to leak kernel memory to user-space, possibly leading
to the disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2942, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the tcf_act_police_dump() function in the Linux
kernel network traffic policing implementation. A data structure in
tcf_act_police_dump() was not initialized properly before being copied
to user-space. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause
an information leak. (CVE-2010-3477, Moderate)

* A missing upper bound integer check was found in the sys_io_submit()
function in the Linux kernel asynchronous I/O implementation. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause an information leak.
(CVE-2010-3067, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting CVE-2010-3067.

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* When two systems using bonding devices in the adaptive load
balancing (ALB) mode communicated with each other, an endless loop of
ARP replies started between these two systems due to a faulty MAC
address update. With this update, the MAC address update no longer
creates unneeded ARP replies. (BZ#629239)

* When running the Connectathon NFS Testsuite with certain clients and
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 as the server, nfsvers4, lock, and test2
failed the Connectathon test. (BZ#625535)

* For UDP/UNIX domain sockets, due to insufficient memory barriers in
the network code, a process sleeping in select() may have missed
notifications about new data. In rare cases, this bug may have caused
a process to sleep forever. (BZ#640117)

* In certain situations, a bug found in either the HTB or TBF network
packet schedulers in the Linux kernel could have caused a kernel panic
when using Broadcom network cards with the bnx2 driver. (BZ#624363)

* Previously, allocating fallback cqr for DASD reserve/release IOCTLs
failed because it used the memory pool of the respective device. This
update preallocates sufficient memory for a single reserve/release
request. (BZ#626828)

* In some situations a bug prevented 'force online' succeeding for a
DASD device. (BZ#626827)

* Using the 'fsstress' utility may have caused a kernel panic.
(BZ#633968)

* This update introduces additional stack guard patches. (BZ#632515)

* A bug was found in the way the megaraid_sas driver handled physical
disks and management IOCTLs. All physical disks were exported to the
disk layer, allowing an oops in megasas_complete_cmd_dpc() when
completing the IOCTL command if a timeout occurred. (BZ#631903)

* Previously, a warning message was returned when a large amount of
messages was passed through netconsole and a considerable amount of
network load was added. With this update, the warning message is no
longer displayed. (BZ#637729)

* Executing a large 'dd' command (1 to 5GB) on an iSCSI device with
the qla3xxx driver caused a system crash due to the incorrect storing
of a private data structure. With this update, the size of the stored
data structure is checked and the system crashes no longer occur.
(BZ#624364)

are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for
each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

[Update 6 December 2010] The package list in this erratum has been
updated to include the kernel-doc packages for the IA32 architecture.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes :

* A flaw in sctp_packet_config() in the Linux kernel's Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation could allow a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3432, Important)

* A missing integer overflow check in snd_ctl_new() in the Linux
kernel's sound subsystem could allow a local, unprivileged user on a
32-bit system to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2010-3442, Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-3442.

Bug fixes :

* Forward time drift was observed on virtual machines using PM
timer-based kernel tick accounting and running on KVM or the Microsoft
Hyper-V Server hypervisor. Virtual machines that were booted with the
divider=x kernel parameter set to a value greater than 1 and that
showed the following in the kernel boot messages were subject to this
issue :

time.c: Using PM based timekeeping

Fine grained accounting for the PM timer is introduced which
eliminates this issue. However, this fix uncovered a bug in the Xen
hypervisor, possibly causing backward time drift. If this erratum is
installed in Xen HVM guests that meet the aforementioned conditions,
it is recommended that the host use kernel-xen-2.6.18-194.26.1.el5 or
newer, which includes a fix (BZ#641915) for the backward time drift.
(BZ#629237)

* With multipath enabled, systems would occasionally halt when the
do_cciss_request function was used. This was caused by
wrongly-generated requests. Additional checks have been added to avoid
the aforementioned issue. (BZ#640193)

* A Sun X4200 system equipped with a QLogic HBA spontaneously rebooted
and logged a Hyper-Transport Sync Flood Error to the system event log.
A Maximum Memory Read Byte Count restriction was added to fix this
bug. (BZ#640919)

* For an active/backup bonding network interface with VLANs on top of
it, when a link failed over, it took a minute for the multicast domain
to be rejoined. This was caused by the driver not sending any IGMP
join packets. The driver now sends IGMP join packets and the multicast
domain is rejoined immediately. (BZ#641002)

* Replacing a disk and trying to rebuild it afterwards caused the
system to panic. When a domain validation request for a hot plugged
drive was sent, the mptscsi driver did not validate its existence.
This could result in the driver accessing random memory and causing
the crash. A check has been added that describes the newly-added
device and reloads the iocPg3 data from the firmware if needed.
(BZ#641137)

* An attempt to create a VLAN interface on a bond of two bnx2 adapters
in two switch configurations resulted in a soft lockup after a few
seconds. This was caused by an incorrect use of a bonding pointer.
With this update, soft lockups no longer occur and creating a VLAN
interface works as expected. (BZ#641254)

* Erroneous pointer checks could have caused a kernel panic. This was
due to a critical value not being copied when a network buffer was
duplicated and consumed by multiple portions of the kernel's network
stack. Fixing the copy operation resolved this bug. (BZ#642746)

* A typo in a variable name caused it to be dereferenced in either
mkdir() or create() which could cause a kernel panic. (BZ#643342)

* SCSI high level drivers can submit SCSI commands which would never
be completed when the device was offline. This was caused by a missing
callback for the request to complete the given command. SCSI requests
are now terminated by calling their callback when a device is offline.
(BZ#644816)

* A kernel panic could have occurred on systems due to a recursive
lock in the 3c59x driver. Recursion is now avoided and this kernel
panic no longer occurs. (BZ#648407)

are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for
each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

[Update 6 December 2010] The package list in this erratum has been
updated to include the kernel-doc packages for the IA32 architecture.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes :

* A flaw in sctp_packet_config() in the Linux kernel's Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation could allow a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3432, Important)

* A missing integer overflow check in snd_ctl_new() in the Linux
kernel's sound subsystem could allow a local, unprivileged user on a
32-bit system to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2010-3442, Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-3442.

Bug fixes :

* Forward time drift was observed on virtual machines using PM
timer-based kernel tick accounting and running on KVM or the Microsoft
Hyper-V Server hypervisor. Virtual machines that were booted with the
divider=x kernel parameter set to a value greater than 1 and that
showed the following in the kernel boot messages were subject to this
issue :

time.c: Using PM based timekeeping

Fine grained accounting for the PM timer is introduced which
eliminates this issue. However, this fix uncovered a bug in the Xen
hypervisor, possibly causing backward time drift. If this erratum is
installed in Xen HVM guests that meet the aforementioned conditions,
it is recommended that the host use kernel-xen-2.6.18-194.26.1.el5 or
newer, which includes a fix (BZ#641915) for the backward time drift.
(BZ#629237)

* With multipath enabled, systems would occasionally halt when the
do_cciss_request function was used. This was caused by
wrongly-generated requests. Additional checks have been added to avoid
the aforementioned issue. (BZ#640193)

* A Sun X4200 system equipped with a QLogic HBA spontaneously rebooted
and logged a Hyper-Transport Sync Flood Error to the system event log.
A Maximum Memory Read Byte Count restriction was added to fix this
bug. (BZ#640919)

* For an active/backup bonding network interface with VLANs on top of
it, when a link failed over, it took a minute for the multicast domain
to be rejoined. This was caused by the driver not sending any IGMP
join packets. The driver now sends IGMP join packets and the multicast
domain is rejoined immediately. (BZ#641002)

* Replacing a disk and trying to rebuild it afterwards caused the
system to panic. When a domain validation request for a hot plugged
drive was sent, the mptscsi driver did not validate its existence.
This could result in the driver accessing random memory and causing
the crash. A check has been added that describes the newly-added
device and reloads the iocPg3 data from the firmware if needed.
(BZ#641137)

* An attempt to create a VLAN interface on a bond of two bnx2 adapters
in two switch configurations resulted in a soft lockup after a few
seconds. This was caused by an incorrect use of a bonding pointer.
With this update, soft lockups no longer occur and creating a VLAN
interface works as expected. (BZ#641254)

* Erroneous pointer checks could have caused a kernel panic. This was
due to a critical value not being copied when a network buffer was
duplicated and consumed by multiple portions of the kernel's network
stack. Fixing the copy operation resolved this bug. (BZ#642746)

* A typo in a variable name caused it to be dereferenced in either
mkdir() or create() which could cause a kernel panic. (BZ#643342)

* SCSI high level drivers can submit SCSI commands which would never
be completed when the device was offline. This was caused by a missing
callback for the request to complete the given command. SCSI requests
are now terminated by calling their callback when a device is offline.
(BZ#644816)

* A kernel panic could have occurred on systems due to a recursive
lock in the 3c59x driver. Recursion is now avoided and this kernel
panic no longer occurs. (BZ#648407)

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for
each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* A heap overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Transparent
Inter-Process Communication protocol (TIPC) implementation. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2010-3859, Important)

* Missing sanity checks were found in gdth_ioctl_alloc() in the gdth
driver in the Linux kernel. A local user with access to '/dev/gdth' on
a 64-bit system could use these flaws to cause a denial of service or
escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-4157, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Bluetooth HCI UART
driver in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4242, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collector for AF_UNIX
sockets. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger a
denial of service (out-of-memory condition). (CVE-2010-4249, Moderate)

* Missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. A
local, unprivileged user could use these flaws to cause information
leaks. (CVE-2010-3876, CVE-2010-4072, CVE-2010-4073, CVE-2010-4075,
CVE-2010-4080, CVE-2010-4083, CVE-2010-4158, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Alan Cox for reporting CVE-2010-4242;
Vegard Nossum for reporting CVE-2010-4249; Vasiliy Kulikov for
reporting CVE-2010-3876; Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2010-4072; and
Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-4073, CVE-2010-4075,
CVE-2010-4080, CVE-2010-4083, and CVE-2010-4158.

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel where, if used in conjunction
with another flaw that can result in a kernel Oops, could possibly
lead to privilege escalation. It does not affect Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4 as the sysctl panic_on_oops variable is turned on by default.
However, as a preventive measure if the variable is turned off by an
administrator, this update addresses the issue. Red Hat would like to
thank Nelson Elhage for reporting this vulnerability. (BZ#659568)

* On Intel I/O Controller Hub 9 (ICH9) hardware, jumbo frame support
is achieved by using page-based sk_buff buffers without any packet
split. The entire frame data is copied to the page(s) rather than some
to the skb->data area and some to the page(s) when performing a
typical packet-split. This caused problems with the filtering code and
frames were getting dropped before they were received by listening
applications. This bug could eventually lead to the IP address being
released and not being able to be re-acquired from DHCP if the MTU
(Maximum Transfer Unit) was changed (for an affected interface using
the e1000e driver). With this update, frames are no longer dropped and
an IP address is correctly re-acquired after a previous release.
(BZ#664667)

backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.","Update the affected kernel packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?e71a804a

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel where, if used in conjunction
with another flaw that can result in a kernel Oops, could possibly
lead to privilege escalation. It does not affect Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4 as the sysctl panic_on_oops variable is turned on by default.
However, as a preventive measure if the variable is turned off by an
administrator, this update addresses the issue. Red Hat would like to
thank Nelson Elhage for reporting this vulnerability. (BZ#659568)

* On Intel I/O Controller Hub 9 (ICH9) hardware, jumbo frame support
is achieved by using page-based sk_buff buffers without any packet
split. The entire frame data is copied to the page(s) rather than some
to the skb->data area and some to the page(s) when performing a
typical packet-split. This caused problems with the filtering code and
frames were getting dropped before they were received by listening
applications. This bug could eventually lead to the IP address being
released and not being able to be re-acquired from DHCP if the MTU

the e1000e driver). With this update, frames are no longer dropped and
an IP address is correctly re-acquired after a previous release.

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that
allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network
configuration information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and
a broadcast address.

It was discovered that the DHCP client daemon, dhclient, did not

such as the client hostname. A malicious DHCP server could send such
an option with a specially crafted value to a DHCP client. If this
option's value was saved on the client system, and then later

small file size limit before running mount.cifs. (CVE-2011-1678)

Note: mount.cifs from the samba packages distributed by Red Hat does
not have the setuid bit set. We recommend that administrators do not
manually set the setuid bit for mount.cifs.

It was found that the 'new' constructor of the Digest module used its
argument as part of the string expression passed to the eval()
function. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute
arbitrary Perl code with the privileges of a Perl program that uses
untrusted input as an argument to the constructor. (CVE-2011-3597)

It was found that the Perl CGI module used a hard-coded value for the
MIME boundary string in multipart/x-mixed-replace content. A remote
attacker could possibly use this flaw to conduct an HTTP response
splitting attack via a specially crafted HTTP request. (CVE-2010-2761)

A CRLF injection flaw was found in the way the Perl CGI module
processed a sequence of non-whitespace preceded by newline characters
in the header. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct an
HTTP response splitting attack via a specially crafted sequence of
characters provided to the CGI module. (CVE-2010-4410)

The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the
implementation of various XML standards. One of those standards is the
XML Path Language (XPath), which is a language for addressing parts of
an XML document.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
entity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a
specially crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked
against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2011-3919)

An off-by-one error, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XML files. A remote attacker
could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when opened in an
application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the application. (CVE-2011-0216)

A flaw was found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions.
If an attacker were able to supply a specially crafted XML file to an
application using libxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that
application to run against the crafted file, it could cause the

multiple flaws.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is older than 5.3.9.  As such, it may be affected by the following
security issues :

  - The 'is_a()' function in PHP 5.3.7 and 5.3.8 triggers a 
    call to '__autoload()'. (CVE-2011-3379)

  - It is possible to create a denial of service condition 
    by sending multiple, specially crafted requests 
    containing parameter values that cause hash collisions 
    when computing the hash values for storage in a hash 
    table.  (CVE-2011-4885)
   
  - An integer overflow exists in the exif_process_IFD_TAG 
    function in exif.c that can allow a remote attacker to 
    read arbitrary memory locations or cause a denial of 
    service condition.  This vulnerability only affects PHP 
    5.4.0beta2 on 32-bit platforms. (CVE-2011-4566)

  - Calls to libxslt are not restricted via
    xsltSetSecurityPrefs(), which could allow an attacker
    to create or overwrite files, resulting in arbitrary
    code execution. (CVE-2012-0057)

  - An error exists in the function 'tidy_diagnose' that
    can allow an attacker to cause the application to 
    dereference a NULL pointer. This causes the application
    to crash. (CVE-2012-0781)

  - The 'PDORow' implementation contains an error that can
    cause application crashes when interacting with the 
    session feature. (CVE-2012-0788)

  - An error exists in the timezone handling such that
    repeated calls to the function 'strtotime' can allow
    a denial of service attack via memory consumption.

The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple
programs on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the
standard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system
cannot function properly.

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way the glibc library read timezone files. If a
carefully-crafted timezone file was loaded by an application linked
against glibc, it could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application. (CVE-2009-5029)

A flaw was found in the way the ldd utility identified dynamically
linked libraries. If an attacker could trick a user into running ldd
on a malicious binary, it could result in arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running ldd. (CVE-2009-5064)

It was discovered that the glibc addmntent() function, used by various
mount helper utilities, did not sanitize its input properly. A local
attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject malformed lines into
the mtab (mounted file systems table) file via certain setuid mount
helpers, if the attacker were allowed to mount to an arbitrary
directory under their control. (CVE-2010-0296)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way the glibc library loaded ELF (Executable and Linking
Format) files. If a carefully-crafted ELF file was loaded by an
application linked against glibc, it could cause the application to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the application. (CVE-2010-0830)

It was discovered that the glibc fnmatch() function did not properly
restrict the use of alloca(). If the function was called on
sufficiently large inputs, it could cause an application using
fnmatch() to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the application. (CVE-2011-1071)

It was found that the glibc addmntent() function, used by various
mount helper utilities, did not handle certain errors correctly when
updating the mtab (mounted file systems table) file. If such utilities
had the setuid bit set, a local attacker could use this flaw to
corrupt the mtab file. (CVE-2011-1089)

It was discovered that the locale command did not produce properly
escaped output as required by the POSIX specification. If an attacker
were able to set the locale environment variables in the environment
of a script that performed shell evaluation on the output of the
locale command, and that script were run with different privileges
than the attacker's, it could execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the script. (CVE-2011-1095)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the glibc fnmatch() function. If
an attacker supplied a long UTF-8 string to an application linked
against glibc, it could cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2011-1659)

A denial of service flaw was found in the remote procedure call (RPC)
implementation in glibc. A remote attacker able to open a large number
of connections to an RPC service that is using the RPC implementation
from glibc, could use this flaw to make that service use an excessive
amount of CPU time. (CVE-2011-4609)

Red Hat Security Response Team.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following
functions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(),
and pipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe
pointer could be released by other processes before it is used to
update the pipe's reader and writer counters. This could lead to a
local denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547,
Important)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted
for this update to take effect.","Update the affected kernel packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?e49d36a5

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.

A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer
Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols handle session renegotiation.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary
plain text to a client's session (for example, an HTTPS connection to
a website). This could force the server to process an attacker's
request as if authenticated using the victim's credentials. This
update partially mitigates this flaw for SSL sessions to HTTP servers
using mod_ssl by rejecting client-requested renegotiation.

Note: This update does not fully resolve the issue for HTTPS servers.
An attack is still possible in configurations that require a
server-initiated renegotiation. Refer to the following Knowledgebase
article for further information:
http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491

A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module.
This module continued to compress large files until compression was
complete, even if the network connection that requested the content
was closed before compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate
to consume large amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large
file. (CVE-2009-1891)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp
module. A malicious FTP server to which requests are being proxied
could use this flaw to crash an httpd child process via a malformed
reply to the EPSV or PASV commands, resulting in a limited denial of
service. (CVE-2009-3094)

A second flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp module. In a
reverse proxy configuration, a remote attacker could use this flaw to
bypass intended access restrictions by creating a carefully-crafted
HTTP Authorization header, allowing the attacker to send arbitrary
commands to the FTP server. (CVE-2009-3095)

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the
Red Hat Security Response Team.

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.

A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer
Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols handle session renegotiation.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary
plain text to a client's session (for example, an HTTPS connection to
a website). This could force the server to process an attacker's
request as if authenticated using the victim's credentials. This
update partially mitigates this flaw for SSL sessions to HTTP servers
using mod_ssl by rejecting client-requested renegotiation.
(CVE-2009-3555)

Note: This update does not fully resolve the issue for HTTPS servers.
An attack is still possible in configurations that require a
server-initiated renegotiation. Refer to the following Knowledgebase
article for further information:
http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491

A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module.
This module continued to compress large files until compression was
complete, even if the network connection that requested the content
was closed before compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate
to consume large amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large
file. (CVE-2009-1891)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp
module. A malicious FTP server to which requests are being proxied
could use this flaw to crash an httpd child process via a malformed
reply to the EPSV or PASV commands, resulting in a limited denial of
service. (CVE-2009-3094)

A second flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp module. In a
reverse proxy configuration, a remote attacker could use this flaw to
bypass intended access restrictions by creating a carefully-crafted
HTTP Authorization header, allowing the attacker to send arbitrary
commands to the FTP server. (CVE-2009-3095)

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the
Apache HTTP Server.

It was found that the hashing routine used by PHP arrays was
susceptible to predictable hash collisions. If an HTTP POST request to
a PHP application contained many parameters whose names map to the
same hash value, a large amount of CPU time would be consumed. This
flaw has been mitigated by adding a new configuration directive,
max_input_vars, that limits the maximum number of parameters processed
per request. By default, max_input_vars is set to 1000.
(CVE-2011-4885)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the PHP exif extension. On
32-bit systems, a specially crafted image file could cause the PHP
interpreter to crash or disclose portions of its memory when a PHP
script tries to extract Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata
from the image file. (CVE-2011-4566)

An insufficient input validation flaw, leading to a buffer over-read,
was found in the PHP exif extension. A specially crafted image file
could cause the PHP interpreter to crash when a PHP script tries to
extract Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata from the image
file. (CVE-2011-0708)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the PHP calendar extension. A
remote attacker able to make a PHP script call SdnToJulian() with a
large value could cause the PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2011-1466)

An off-by-one flaw was found in PHP. If an attacker uploaded a file
with a specially crafted file name it could cause a PHP script to
attempt to write a file to the root (/) directory. By default, PHP
runs as the 'apache' user, preventing it from writing to the root
directory. (CVE-2011-2202)

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

credentials. The provided credentials have the highest privilege
possible on the remote host.  Yet Nessus encountered permissions
issues while accessing items during the scan.

It is likely that this condition is caused by one or more of the
following:

1)  A plugin tried to access a resource that requires a special
    privilege level such as NT_AUTHORITY on Windows.  The resource
    may have had its permissions altered since the plugin was
    written.
2)  Environmental issues may have caused an intermittent failure
    in authentication that caused Nessus to stop attempting
    privilege escalation.
3)  A resource on the host that Nessus attempts to access multiple
    times may be configured with access limits.  Related lockouts may
    look like permissions failures.
4)  Nessus may have tried to access a resource that does not exist
    on a target that fails to properly report permissions issues.
    For instance, on some legacy unix systems such as AIX or HP-UX
    there is no way to distinguish a missing resource from a
    permissions error.

If you believe that the plugin indicated attempted to access the
wrong resource or a resource that has recently received special OS
protection, please contact Tenable Support.","n/a","","
